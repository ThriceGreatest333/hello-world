# hello-world
First project--Don't judge me!

I'm a crazy, wide-eyed dreamer that wants more. I've been wandering, searching, & stumbling through life in quiet desperation in an internal quest to make my mark on the world. Like everyone else on the face of the planet, I have a few ideas for apps/websites that I'd like to explore. Coming from absolutely 0 programming experience, simply trying to find out where to begin has been pretty overwhelming. 
I don't know if I have the right brain for this type of thing. Math, lifeless numbers & cold technical jargon have never appealed to me. But creating something with my own two hands does. So here I am!!
